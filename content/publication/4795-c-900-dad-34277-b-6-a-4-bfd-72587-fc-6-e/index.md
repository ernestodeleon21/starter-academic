abstract: "The knowledge gap hypothesis—the assumption that an increasing flow of\
  \ news on a topic fosters a gap in knowledge between the more and the less educated—has\
  \ been demonstrated in numerous studies throughout the past 60 years. Knowledge\
  \ gaps are attributed to individual differences in media selection and information\
  \ processing capacities. However, it has been difficult to investigate the relative\
  \ influence of selection and processing with conventional research methods. We used\
  \ an innovative combination of individual-level digital trace and survey data collected\
  \ in Switzerland (\n            n\n             = 403) and Germany (\n         \
  \   n\n             = 471) to study the widening of knowledge gaps throughout the\
  \ communication process. The data were collected at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,\
  \ an extraordinary period of extremely high information inflow on a novel topic.\
  \ Our analyses show that individuals with lower education use less online news in\
  \ general and less COVID-19-related news in particular than those with higher education,\
  \ which results in a difference in knowledge about the origin of COVID-19 (but not\
  \ on its severity). However, those with lower education do not have a similar share\
  \ of COVID-19-related news in their news diet, and they learn even more than those\
  \ with higher education from the COVID-19-related news that they are exposed to.\
  \ Our study thus suggests that knowledge gaps are predominantly a result of selecting\
  \ into news use."
