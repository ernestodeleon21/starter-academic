abstract: AbstractWhat happens when a crisis such as COVID-19 fully occupies the political
  and media agenda? Do previous political concerns, such as those on migration, remain
  salient? Here, I propose and validate a model of issue survival during times of
  crisis. I argue that issues remain salient when individuals are able to cognitively
  link “displaced” issues with the ongoing crisis. Such connections between displaced
  issues and the crisis can be influenced by the media, who, through a process of
  networked agenda setting, help establish connections between issues. I test this
  model on the salience of migration during the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland and
  Germany. Leveraging panel surveys administered before and during lockdowns, I show
  that the issue of migration was displaced during the crisis. Nevertheless, as proposed
  by the model, this decline in issue salience did not occur for individuals connecting
  migration to the pandemic. Combining panels with individual-level media consumption
  data obtained through webtracking, I provide evidence that issue survival was significantly
  related to the consumption of news stories linking migration to the COVID-19 crisis.
  The study raises questions about the flow of public opinion during moments of mass
  uncertainty and highlights the key role media consumption can play in understanding
  previous issues in new a light.
