abstract: The increasing volume of online news has made it considerably more difficult
  for scholars to identify political news. Ongoing advances in computational methods
  and natural language processing help to tackle this challenge. Yet, scholars who
  aim to take a comparative approach to study political news content are facing the
  challenge of addressing multiple languages. Training individual supervised machine
  learning classifiers for multiple languages is a costly and time-consuming process.
  Instead of relying on labels generated by manual coding, we explore the use of `distant'
  labels created by cues in article URLs. Specifically, we explore how sections reflected
  in URLs (e.g., nytimes.com/politics/) can help create training material for supervised
  machine learning classifiers. Using cues provided by news media organizations, such
  an approach allows for efficient political news identification at scale, while also
  allowing easy implementation across languages. We rely on an existing data set that
  consists of approximately 870,000 URLs of news-related content from four different
  countries (Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Poland), with a large sample of hand-labelled
  articles for each country. We test this method by providing a comparison to 'classical'
  supervised machine learning and a multilingual BERT model. We also expand topic
  identification to sports, entertainment, and economic news. Our results suggest
  that the use of URL section cues to distantly annotate texts provides a cheap and
  easy-to-implement way of classifying large volumes of news texts that can save researchers
  much valuable resources without necessarily having to sacrifice quality.
