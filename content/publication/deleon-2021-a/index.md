abstract: This study explores shifts in political trust during the COVID-19 pandemic
  in Switzerland, examining the role that media consumption and threat perceptions
  played in individuals’ propensity to `rally-round the flag’. We combine panel surveys
  taken before and during a nation-wide lockdown to webtracking data of participant’s
  desktop devices to paint a nuanced picture of media effects during the crisis. First,
  we show that readership of hyperpartisan media is linked to reduced political trust.
  Second, we demonstrate that citizens’ threat perceptions condition the effect of
  news consumption on political trust, with increased media consumption having opposite
  effects for those worried about the pandemic compared to those who do not feel threatened.
  Our findings highlight the differential effect that news consumption can have on
  public trust in government, contributing both to our understanding of media effects,
  and of public opinion during moments of crisis.
