abstract: The article examines news trajectories used by individuals to access mainstream
  journalistic media in Germany and German-speaking Switzerland during the first peak
  of COVID-19 in Europe. It also discusses the role of individual characteristics
  related to sociodemographics, political, and media attitudes in predisposition towards
  specific modes of news access. For this aim, it combines survey data with data on
  individuals' engagement with news automatically tracked in spring 2020. The findings
  of the article highlight the prevalence of accessing news via search engines (search
  trajectory) and by directly going to news websites (routine trajectory). The study
  also demonstrates the important role of political and media attitudes in prevalence
  of specific modes of news access which, however, differs between the countries,
  thus emphasizing the importance of conducting more comparative research using tracking
  data.
