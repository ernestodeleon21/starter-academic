abstract: In this study, we address the role of emotions in political news sharing
  on Facebook to better understand the complex relationship between journalism, emotions,
  and politics. Categorizing Facebook Reactions (particularly, the Sad, Angry, Love,
  and Wow Reactions) according to the discrete emotions model, we evaluate how positive
  versus negative political content relates to emotional responses, and how this consequentially
  influences the degree to which articles are shared across social media in the context
  of an election. We focus on the landmark 2018 Mexican elections to enable a nuanced
  conversation on how cues of user emotion predict the far-reaching dissemination
  of news articles on Facebook during a moment of heightened political attention.
  Our findings demonstrate a negativity bias in news sharing and engagement, showing
  an outsized prevalence of anger in response to political news. In addition, we provide
  evidence of a novel sadness bias in the sharing of political coverage, suggesting
  that emotions considered as deactivating should be reevaluated in the context of
  social media.
