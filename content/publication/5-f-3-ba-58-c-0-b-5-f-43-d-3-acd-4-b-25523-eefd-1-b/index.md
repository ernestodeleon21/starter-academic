abstract: 'This study explores shifts in political trust during the outbreak of the
  COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, examining the role that media consumption and
  threat perceptions played in individuals’ trust in politics. We combine panel surveys
  taken before and during the first nation-wide lockdown with webtracking data of
  participants'' online behaviour to paint a nuanced picture of media effects during
  the crisis. Our work has several findings. First, political trust, an attitude known
  for its stability, increased following lockdown. Second, consumption of mainstream
  news on COVID-19 directly hindered this increase, with those reading more news having
  lower over-time trust, while the relatively minor alternative news consumption had
  no direct effect on political trust. Third, threat perceptions a) to health and
  b) from the policy response to the pandemic, have strong and opposite effects on
  political trust, with threats to health increasing trust, and threats from the government
  policy response decreasing it. Lastly, these threat perceptions condition the effect
  of COVID-19 news consumption on political trust: perceptions of threat had the power
  to both exacerbate and mute the effect of media consumption on government trust
  during the pandemic. Notably, we show that the expected negative effect of alternative
  news on political trust only exists for those who did not think COVID-19 posed a
  threat to their health, while public service news consumption reduced the negative
  effect produced by government threat perceptions. The paper therefore advances our
  understanding of the nuanced nature of media effects, particularly as relates to
  alternative media, especially during moments of crisis.'
