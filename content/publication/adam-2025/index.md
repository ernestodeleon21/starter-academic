abstract: "Abstract\n               As COVID-19 escalated into a global health crisis,\
  \ pandemic-related conspiracy theories emerged rapidly. Understanding how and under\
  \ which conditions media influence their dissemination is essential. This study\
  \ leverages unique data from 2-wave survey panels in Germany and German-speaking\
  \ Switzerland, along with online tracking, to explore how individuals’ preexisting\
  \ beliefs and media exposure influence the formation of pandemic-related conspiracy\
  \ beliefs. The findings reveal direct exposure effects: alternative media, when\
  \ supporting the conspiratorial claims, fostered conspiracy beliefs while mainstream\
  \ media reduced conspiracy beliefs after debunking. Preexisting beliefs further\
  \ conditioned these effects: individuals with strong populist views or low political\
  \ trust selectively engaged with alternative media and selectively avoided mainstream\
  \ sources. This resulted in two indirect pathways to the dissemination of conspiracy\
  \ beliefs: people who selected into conspiracy-supporting content on alternative\
  \ media experienced a reinforcement of conspiracy beliefs whereas people who (partially)\
  \ avoided mainstream media counterargued the conspiracy-opposing information, also\
  \ strengthening their conspiracy beliefs."
