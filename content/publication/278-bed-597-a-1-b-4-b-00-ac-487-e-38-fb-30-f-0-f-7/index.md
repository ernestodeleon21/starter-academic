abstract: This paper offers a critical look at the promises and drawbacks of a popular,
  novel data collection technique—online tracking—from the point of view of sample
  composition. Using data from two large-scale studies about political attitudes and
  information consumption behavior carried out in Germany and Switzerland, we find
  that the likelihood of participation in a tracking study at several critical dropout
  points is systematically related to the gender, age, and education of participants,
  with men, young, and more educated participants being less likely to dropout of
  the studies. Our findings also show that these patterns are incremental, as changes
  in sample composition accumulate over successive study stages. Political interest
  and ideology were also significantly related to the likelihood of participation
  in tracking research. The study explores some of the most common concerns associated
  with tracking research leading to non-participation, finding that they also differ
  across demographic groups. The implications of these findings are discussed.
