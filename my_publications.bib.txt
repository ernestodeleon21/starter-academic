  abstract = {This study explores shifts in political trust during the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, examining the role that media consumption and threat perceptions played in individuals’ propensity to `rally-round the flag’. We combine panel surveys taken before and during a nation-wide lockdown to webtracking data of participant’s desktop devices to paint a nuanced picture of media effects during the crisis. First, we show that readership of hyperpartisan media is linked to reduced political trust. Second, we demonstrate that citizens’ threat perceptions condition the effect of news consumption on political trust, with increased media consumption having opposite effects for those worried about the pandemic compared to those who do not feel threatened. Our findings highlight the differential effect that news consumption can have on public trust in government, contributing both to our understanding of media effects, and of public opinion during moments of crisis.}

  abstract = {The article examines news trajectories used by individuals to access mainstream journalistic media in Germany and German-speaking Switzerland during the first peak of COVID-19 in Europe. It also discusses the role of individual characteristics related to sociodemographics, political, and media attitudes in predisposition towards specific modes of news access. For this aim, it combines survey data with data on individuals' engagement with news automatically tracked in spring 2020. The findings of the article highlight the prevalence of accessing news via search engines (search trajectory) and by directly going to news websites (routine trajectory). The study also demonstrates the important role of political and media attitudes in prevalence of specific modes of news access which, however, differs between the countries, thus emphasizing the importance of conducting more comparative research using tracking data.}

  abstract = {Citizens increasingly rely on social media platforms to not only read but to share news on politics. To date, little is known about how patterns of news sharing diverge across contexts. This study seeks to remedy this by investigating the news that users share on social media and the news published by news media organizations (a) across election and routine periods and (b) across eight countries (i.e., Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom). Using a sample of the useNews dataset (265,714 URLs shared over 12 million times on Facebook), findings show that elections are linked to increases in political news publication, but even larger increases in political news sharing -- these changes, however, vary significantly by country. We also show that, overall, political news is shared more often than news publication patterns would suggest, proposing higher political interest by Facebook users than previously thought.}

Here, we address the role of emotions in political news consumption on Social Network Sites, drawing on communication and psychology theories to study how news article sentiment and framing determine emotional responses and dissemination of political news articles on Facebook during an election. Studying the 2018 Mexican elections, findings support traditional criteria of emotional engagement with political news, providing further evidence of news sentiment on emotions, and of a negativity bias in news sharing and engagement. The results also provide evidence for the existence of a novel sadness bias in the sharing and engagement of political news.}

  abstract = {Patterns of news consumption are changing drastically. Citizens increasingly rely on social media such as Facebook to read and share political news. With the power of these platforms to expose citizens to political information, the implications for democracy are profound, making understanding what is shared during elections a priority on the research agenda. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet explicitly explored how elections transform news sharing behaviour on Facebook. This study begins to remedy this by (a) investigating changes in news coverage and news sharing behaviour on Facebook by comparing election and routine periods, and by (b) addressing the `news gap' between preferences of journalists and news consumers on social media. Employing a novel data set of news articles (N = 83,054) in Mexico, findings show that during periods of heightened political activity, both the publication and dissemination of political news increases, the gap between the news choices of journalists and consumers narrows, and that news sharing resembles a zero-sum game, with increased political news sharing leading to a decrease in the sharing of other news.}

  abstract = {Weberian research has often assumed that written immigration policies reveal governments’ consistent objectives. This research struggles to make sense of the finding that immigration policies are frequently inconsistent: combining or alternating between restrictive and non-restrictive measures. This study uses global data sets to reveal what proportion of immigration policies are inconsistent and develops a measure of policy inconsistency to track how immigration policy inconsistency varies across time and space. We use these techniques to generate limited empirical support for macro-political explanations of policy inconsistency, that focus on variables located at the national scale. We then use these findings and analyses to argue in favour of further research into micro-political explanations, that focus on the behaviour of ordinary officials and migrants at the local scale. Exploring the impact of micro-political factors on national immigration policies will require substantially improved dialogues between quantitative and qualitative research.}
