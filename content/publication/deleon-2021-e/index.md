abstract: Patterns of news consumption are changing drastically. Citizens increasingly
  rely on social media such as Facebook to read and share political news. With the
  power of these platforms to expose citizens to political information, the implications
  for democracy are profound, making understanding what is shared during elections
  a priority on the research agenda. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no
  study has yet explicitly explored how elections transform news sharing behaviour
  on Facebook. This study begins to remedy this by (a) investigating changes in news
  coverage and news sharing behaviour on Facebook by comparing election and routine
  periods, and by (b) addressing the `news gap' between preferences of journalists
  and news consumers on social media. Employing a novel data set of news articles
  (N = 83,054) in Mexico, findings show that during periods of heightened political
  activity, both the publication and dissemination of political news increases, the
  gap between the news choices of journalists and consumers narrows, and that news
  sharing resembles a zero-sum game, with increased political news sharing leading
  to a decrease in the sharing of other news.
