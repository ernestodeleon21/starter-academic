I’m a political communication PhD candidate at the Institute of Communication and Media Studies at the University of Bern, in Switzerland. Currently, I’m part of the research project “Reciprocal relations between populist radical-right attitudes and political information behavior” led by Prof Dr Silke Adam (supervisor) at the University of Bern, and Prof Dr Michaela Maier at the University of Koblenz-Landau. 

My research focuses on political information flows in a digital age and its effects on political attitudes. To do so, I make use of computational social science methodologies to explore web behaviour, social media use, and conduct large-scale text analysis.
