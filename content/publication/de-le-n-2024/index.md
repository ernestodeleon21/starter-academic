abstract: This entry explores hyperpartisan news, a contentious aspect of the contemporary
  media landscape characterised by its overt political bias and confrontational style.
  Unlike traditional news outlets, hyperpartisan platforms prioritise advocacy over
  objectivity, fueling polarising narratives and fostering anti-establishment sentiments.
  They often frame societal issues as battles between 'the people' and entrenched
  elites, amplifying populist rhetoric. This entry shows how hyperpartisan news intersects
  with broader issues of misinformation, toxicity, and conspiracy theories online.
  These sites are implicated in disseminating misleading information, often perpetuating
  hateful discourse and endorsing conspiracy theories, particularly during crises
  like the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, this entry sheds light on the latest research
  revealing who the public for these news media is, providing a reflection as to why
  individuals seek out and engage with this type of news content.
