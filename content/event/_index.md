  caption: "Teaching is central to my academic work. I specialize in helping students build strong foundations in communication science, computational methods, political communication, and statistical reasoning. Whether designing courses or leading tutorials, I focus on making complex ideas accessible, hands-on, and relevant. I take great pride in the consistently strong evaluations and feedback I receive, and I see teaching as a collaborative, rewarding part of research and public scholarship."
