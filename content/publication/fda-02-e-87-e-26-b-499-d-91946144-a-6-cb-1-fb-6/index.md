abstract: The article examines news trajectories used by individuals to access mainstream
  journalistic media in Germany and German-speaking Switzerland during the first peak
  of COVID-19 in Europe. It discusses the role of individual characteristics related
  to sociodemographics, political, and media attitudes in predisposition towards specific
  modes of news access. For this aim, it combines survey data with data on individualstextquoteright
  engagement with news automatically tracked in spring 2020. The findings of the article
  highlight the prevalence of accessing news via search engines (search trajectory)
  and by directly going to news websites (routine trajectory). The study also demonstrates
  the important role of political and media attitudes in the prevalence of specific
  modes of news access, which, however, differs between the countries, thus emphasizing
  the importance of conducting more comparative research using tracking data.
