abstract: This article evaluates the quality of data collection in individual-level
  desktop web tracking used in the social sciences and shows that the existing approaches
  face sampling issues, validity issues due to the lack of content-level data and
  their disregard for the variety of devices and long-tail consumption patterns as
  well as transparency and privacy issues. To overcome some of these problems, the
  article introduces a new academic web tracking solution, WebTrack, an open-source
  tracking tool maintained by a major European research institution, GESIS. The design
  logic, the interfaces, and the backend requirements for WebTrack are discussed,
  followed by a detailed examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool.
  Finally, using data from 1,185 participants, the article empirically illustrates
  how an improvement in data collection through WebTrack leads to innovative shifts
  in the use of tracking data. As WebTrack allows for collecting the content people
  are exposed to beyond the classical news platforms, it can greatly improve the detection
  of politics-related information consumption in tracking data through automated content
  analysis compared to traditional approaches that rely on the source-level analysis.
