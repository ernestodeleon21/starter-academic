abstract: The rise of populist radical right (PRR) ideas stresses the importance of
  understanding how individuals engage with PRR content online. However, this task
  is complicated by the variety of channels through which such engagement can take
  place. In this article, we systematically compare computational approaches for detecting
  PRR content in textual data. Using 66 dictionary, classic supervised machine learning,
  and deep learning (DL) models, we compare how these distinct approaches perform
  on the PRR detection task for three Germanophone test datasets and how their performance
  is affected by different modes of text preprocessing. In addition to individual
  models, we examine the performance of 330 ensemble models combining the above-mentioned
  approaches for the dataset with a particularly high volume of noise. Our findings
  demonstrate that the DL models, in combination with more computationally intense
  forms of preprocessing, show the best performance among the individual models, but
  it remains suboptimal in the case of more noisy datasets. While the use of ensemble
  models shows some improvement for specific modes of preprocessing, overall, it mostly
  remains on par with individual DL models, thus stressing the challenging nature
  of computational detection of PRR content.
