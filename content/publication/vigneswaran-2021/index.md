abstract: 'Weberian research has often assumed that written immigration policies reveal
  governments’ objectives to restrict or not restrict migration. As a result, this
  research struggles to make sense of the finding that immigration policies are frequently
  inconsistent: combining or alternating between restrictive and non-restrictive measures.
  This study uses global data sets to reveal what proportion of immigration policies
  are inconsistent and develops a measure of policy inconsistency to track how immigration
  policy inconsistency varies across time. We use these techniques to generate limited
  empirical support for macro-political explanations of policy inconsistency, which
  focus on variables located at the national scale such as policy-cycles, ‘grand bargains’
  between advocacy coalitions, and policy-maker selectivity. We then use these findings
  of the limited support for macro-political explanations to argue in favour of further
  research into micro-political explanations, which focus on the behaviour of ordinary
  officials and migrants at the local scale. We then discuss the potential for improving
  dialogues between quantitative and qualitative research in order to further explore
  the impact of micro-political factors on national immigration policies.'
