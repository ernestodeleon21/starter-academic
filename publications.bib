  title     = "Tracing Knowledge Gaps: Investigating the Influence of Education on News Exposure and Knowledge Using Digital Trace Data",
  abstract  = "The knowledge gap hypothesis—the assumption that an increasing flow of news on a topic fosters a gap in knowledge between the more and the less educated—has been demonstrated in numerous studies throughout the past 60 years. Knowledge gaps are attributed to individual differences in media selection and information processing capacities. However, it has been difficult to investigate the relative influence of selection and processing with conventional research methods. We used an innovative combination of individual-level digital trace and survey data collected in Switzerland (n = 403) and Germany (n = 471) to study the widening of knowledge gaps throughout the communication process. The data were collected at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an extraordinary period of extremely high information inflow on a novel topic. Our analyses show that individuals with lower education use less online news in general and less COVID-19-related news in particular than those with higher education, which results in a difference in knowledge about the origin of COVID-19 (but not on its severity). However, those with lower education do not have a similar share of COVID-19-related news in their news diet, and they learn even more than those with higher education from the COVID-19-related news that they are exposed to. Our study thus suggests that knowledge gaps are predominantly a result of selecting into news use.",

  title     = "Misperceptions of Public Opinion During Crises: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic",
  abstract  = "How we perceive the public opinion climate can have important consequences on our own opinions and behaviors. Such perceptions are especially relevant during moments of widespread crisis, as they may influence support and compliance with crisis response measures. In this paper, we address what factors inform misperceptions of public opinion during these important moments. We focus on two complementary processes, internal and external crisis information processing, to explain variation in public opinion misperceptions of three measures during the COVID-19 pandemic (masking, use of a contact tracing app, and vaccination). Analyses of 82 weekly waves of longitudinal rolling cross-sectional surveys of the Swiss population during two years of the pandemic (N = 36,667) demonstrate that individuals regularly underestimated the popularity of these measures. We find that those who were in the opinion minority (usually those strongly opposed to these measures) had less accurate estimations of public opinion. News media played an important role for misperceptions. When it comes to the correction of misperceptions, individuals reporting to be regular news readers were more likely to have more accurate perceptions of public opinion. Combining the survey data with measures of media salience across news media published during this period, ARIMA time series modeling shows that the salience of measures in the media affects public opinion misperceptions for app usage and masking. Implications for the field of political communication are discussed both in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for crises more generally.",

However, this task is complicated by the variety of channels through which such engagement can take place. In this article, we systematically compare computational approaches for detecting PRR content in textual data. Using 66 dictionary, classic supervised machine learning, and deep learning (DL) models, we compare how these distinct approaches perform on the PRR detection task for three Germanophone test datasets and how their performance is affected by different modes of text preprocessing. In addition to individual models, we examine the performance of 330 ensemble models combining the above-mentioned approaches for the dataset with a particularly high volume of noise. Our findings demonstrate that the DL models, in combination with more computationally intense forms of preprocessing, show the best performance among the individual models, but it remains suboptimal in the case of more noisy datasets. While the use of ensemble models shows some improvement for specific modes of preprocessing, overall, it mostly remains on par with individual DL models, thus stressing the challenging nature of computational detection of PRR content.",

To overcome some of these problems, the article introduces a new academic web tracking solution, WebTrack, an open-source tracking tool maintained by a major European research institution, GESIS. The design logic, the interfaces, and the backend requirements for WebTrack are discussed, followed by a detailed examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool. Finally, using data from 1,185 participants, the article empirically illustrates how an improvement in data collection through WebTrack leads to innovative shifts in the use of tracking data. As WebTrack allows for collecting the content people are exposed to beyond the classical news platforms, it can greatly improve the detection of politics-related information consumption in tracking data through automated content analysis compared to traditional approaches that rely on the source-level analysis.",

  abstract  = "Research has explored the links between personality and political news consumption, resulting in mixed results that vary across platforms. One potential reason for these inconclusive patterns might be that previous work has exclusively relied on self-reported measures of political news consumption. Considering that personality has been linked to biased response behavior in the past, we investigate to what extent the relationship is affected by potential measurement errors associated with different capturing methods. To do so, we introduce an innovative measurement technique capturing actual internet use through webtracking. While we do not find strong evidence that personality is systematically related to over- or underestimating one's political news consumption, the comparison between the behavioral webtracking measure and self-reported news consumption nevertheless reveals significant differences: notably, openness is positively associated with self-reported online news consumption, but this relationship does not hold in the webtracking data. Instead, when using behavioral measures, neuroticism is a better predictor of political news consumption – an association not observed in the self-reported data. Our insights refine our understanding of the interplay between personality and online political news consumption and enhance the broader discourse on survey response behaviors linked to personality.",

We do so by painting a detailed portrait of HAC media users, detailing 1) who consumes HAC media; 2) how they access it; and 3) how its consumption relates to public opinion.

Our results show that those exposed to HAC media have a strong distrust of government and place themselves at the ideological extremes.

Lastly, we show that those who consumed HAC media developed distinct opinions about the threat posed by COVID-19, mirroring the sentiments expressed in HAC media that the danger of the virus was exaggerated and that the real threat was to individual freedoms. With this case study, we showcase the theoretical utility of taking an integrated approach to HAC media, while providing nuanced insights into their audience.",

  abstract  = "What happens when a crisis such as COVID-19 fully occupies the political and media agenda? Do previous political concerns, such as those on migration, remain salient? Here, I propose and validate a model of issue survival during times of crisis. I argue that issues remain salient when individuals are able to cognitively link “displaced” issues with the ongoing crisis. Such connections between displaced issues and the crisis can be influenced by the media, who, through a process of networked agenda setting, help establish connections between issues. I test this model on the salience of migration during the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland and Germany. Leveraging panel surveys administered before and during lockdowns, I show that the issue of migration was displaced during the crisis. Nevertheless, as proposed by the model, this decline in issue salience did not occur for individuals connecting migration to the pandemic. Combining panels with individual-level media consumption data obtained through webtracking, I provide evidence that issue survival was significantly related to the consumption of news stories linking migration to the COVID-19 crisis. The study raises questions about the flow of public opinion during moments of mass uncertainty and highlights the key role media consumption can play in understanding previous issues in new a light.",

Our findings also show that these patterns are incremental, as changes in sample composition accumulate over successive study stages.

To paint a broad picture of these differences, we compare the news sharing gap (a) across election and routine periods and (b) across eight countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Analyzing 265,714 articles shared over 12 million times on Facebook, findings show that elections are broadly linked to increases in political news publication, but even larger increases in political news sharing. The study reveals how, overall, political news is shared more often than news publication patterns would suggest, proposing higher political interest by Facebook users than previously thought. In most cases, political news sharing far outpaces political news production in the form of a “negative” news sharing gap, with the relative demand for political news (in the form of news sharing) being higher than the supply.

We propose that instead of rely-ing on thematic labels generated by manual coding, researchers can use {\textquoteleft}distant{\textquoteright} labels created by cues in article URLs. Sections reflected in URLs (e.g., nytimes.com/politics/) can therefore help create training material for supervised machine learning classifiers. Using cues provided by news media organizations, such an approach allows for efficient political news identification at scale while facilitating imple-mentation across languages. Using a dataset of approximately 870,000 URLs of news-related content from four countries (Italy, Germany, Netherlands, and Poland), we test this method by providing a comparison to {\textquoteleft}classical{\textquoteright} supervised machine learning and a multilingual BERT model, across four news topics. Our results suggest that the use of URL section cues to distantly annotate texts provides a cheap and easy-to-implement way of classifying large volumes of news texts that can save researchers many valuable resources without having to sacrifice quality.",

  abstract  = "This study explores shifts in political trust during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, examining the role that media consumption and threat perceptions played in individuals{\textquoteright} trust in politics. We combine panel surveys taken before and during the first nation-wide lockdown with webtracking data of participants' online behaviour to paint a nuanced picture of media effects during the crisis. Our work has several findings. First, political trust, an attitude known for its stability, increased following lockdown. Second, consumption of mainstream news on COVID-19 directly hindered this increase, with those reading more news having lower over-time trust, while the relatively minor alternative news consumption had no direct effect on political trust. Third, threat perceptions a) to health and b) from the policy response to the pandemic, have strong and opposite effects on political trust, with threats to health increasing trust, and threats from the government policy response decreasing it. Lastly, these threat perceptions condition the effect of COVID-19 news consumption on political trust: perceptions of threat had the power to both exacerbate and mute the effect of media consumption on government trust during the pandemic. Notably, we show that the expected negative effect of alternative news on political trust only exists for those who did not think COVID-19 posed a threat to their health, while public service news consumption reduced the negative effect produced by government threat perceptions. The paper therefore advances our understanding of the nuanced nature of media effects, particularly as relates to alternative media, especially during moments of crisis.",

  title     = "A Sadness Bias in Political News Sharing? The Role of Discrete Emotions in the Engagement and Dissemination of Political News on Facebook",
  abstract  = "In this study, we address the role of emotions in political news sharing on Facebook to better understand the complex relationship between journalism, emotions, and politics. Categorizing Facebook Reactions (particularly, the Sad, Angry, Love, and Wow Reactions) according to the discrete emotions model, we evaluate how positive versus negative political content relates to emotional responses, and how this consequentially influences the degree to which articles are shared across social media in the context of an election. We focus on the landmark 2018 Mexican elections to enable a nuanced conversation on how cues of user emotion predict the far-reaching dissemination of news articles on Facebook during a moment of heightened political attention. Our findings demonstrate a negativity bias in news sharing and engagement, showing an outsized prevalence of anger in response to political news. In addition, we provide evidence of a novel sadness bias in the sharing of political coverage, suggesting that emotions considered as deactivating should be reevaluated in the context of social media.",
