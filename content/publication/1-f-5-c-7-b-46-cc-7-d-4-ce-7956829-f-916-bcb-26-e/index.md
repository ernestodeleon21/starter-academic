abstract: To understand and measure political information consumption in the high-choice
  media environment, we need new methods to trace individual interactions with online
  content and novel techniques to analyse and detect politics-related information.
  In this paper, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the performance
  of automated content analysis techniques for detecting political content in the
  German language across different platforms. Using three validation datasets, we
  compare the performance of three groups of detection techniques relying on dictionaries,
  classic supervised machine learning, and deep learning. We also examine the impact
  of different modes of data preprocessing on the low-cost implementations of these
  techniques using a large set (n = 66) of models. Our results show the limited impact
  of preprocessing on model performance, with the best results for less noisy data
  being achieved by deep learning- and classic machine learning-based models, in contrast
  to the more robust performance of dictionary-based models on noisy data.
