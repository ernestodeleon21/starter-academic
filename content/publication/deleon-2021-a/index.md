abstract: "This study explores shifts in political trust during the outbreak of the\
  \ COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, examining the role that media consumption and\
  \ threat perceptions played in individuals’ trust in politics. We combine panel\
  \ surveys taken before and during the first nation-wide lockdown with webtracking\
  \ data of participants' online behaviour to paint a nuanced picture of media effects\
  \ during the crisis. Our work has several findings. First, political trust, an attitude\
  \ known for its stability, increased following lockdown. Second, consumption of\
  \ mainstream news on COVID-19 directly hindered this increase, with those reading\
  \ more news having lower over-time trust, while the relatively minor alternative\
  \ news consumption had no direct effect on political trust. Third, threat perceptions\
  \ a) to health and b) from the policy response to the pandemic, have strong and\
  \ opposite effects on political trust, with threats to health increasing trust,\
  \ and threats from the government policy response decreasing it. Lastly, these threat\
  \ perceptions condition the effect of COVID-19 news consumption on political trust:\
  \ perceptions of threat had the power to both exacerbate and mute the effect of\
  \ media consumption on government trust during the pandemic. Notably, we show that\
  \ the expected negative effect of alternative news on political trust only exists\
  \ for those who did not think COVID-19 posed a threat to their health, while public\
  \ service news consumption reduced the negative effect produced by government threat\
  \ perceptions. The paper therefore advances our understanding of the nuanced nature\
  \ of media effects, particularly as relates to alternative media, especially during\
  \ moments of crisis."
