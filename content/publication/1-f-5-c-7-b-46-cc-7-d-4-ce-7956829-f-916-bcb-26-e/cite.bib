 abstract = {To understand and measure political information consumption in the high-choice media environment, we need new methods to trace individual interactions with online content and novel techniques to analyse and detect politics-related information. In this paper, we report the results of a comparative analysis of the performance of automated content analysis techniques for detecting political content in the German language across different platforms. Using three validation datasets, we compare the performance of three groups of detection techniques relying on dictionaries, classic supervised machine learning, and deep learning. We also examine the impact of different modes of data preprocessing on the low-cost implementations of these techniques using a large set (n = 66) of models. Our results show the limited impact of preprocessing on model performance, with the best results for less noisy data being achieved by deep learning- and classic machine learning-based models, in contrast to the more robust performance of dictionary-based models on noisy data.},
