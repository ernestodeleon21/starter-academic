abstract: 'Weberian research has often assumed that written immigration policies reveal
  governments’ consistent objectives. This research struggles to make sense of the
  finding that immigration policies are frequently inconsistent: combining or alternating
  between restrictive and non-restrictive measures. This study uses global data sets
  to reveal what proportion of immigration policies are inconsistent and develops
  a measure of policy inconsistency to track how immigration policy inconsistency
  varies across time and space. We use these techniques to generate limited empirical
  support for macro-political explanations of policy inconsistency, that focus on
  variables located at the national scale. We then use these findings and analyses
  to argue in favour of further research into micro-political explanations, that focus
  on the behaviour of ordinary officials and migrants at the local scale. Exploring
  the impact of micro-political factors on national immigration policies will require
  substantially improved dialogues between quantitative and qualitative research.'
