 abstract = {Citizens on Social Network Sites are constantly exposed to news detailing the latest in the political grapevine, making sites such as Facebook a crucial source of political news consumption and opinion formation. Here, we address the role of emotions in political news consumption on Social Network Sites, drawing on communication and psychology theories to study how news article sentiment and framing determine emotional responses and dissemination of political news articles on Facebook during an election. Studying the 2018 Mexican elections, findings support traditional criteria of emotional engagement with political news, providing further evidence of news sentiment on emotions, and of a negativity bias in news sharing and engagement. The results also provide evidence for the existence of a novel sadness bias in the sharing and engagement of political news.},
