abstract: Citizens increasingly rely on social media platforms to not only read but
  to share news on politics. To date, little is known about how patterns of news sharing
  diverge across contexts. This study seeks to remedy this by investigating the news
  that users share on social media and the news published by news media organizations
  (a) across election and routine periods and (b) across eight countries (i.e., Australia,
  Austria, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom).
  Using a sample of the useNews dataset (265,714 URLs shared over 12 million times
  on Facebook), findings show that elections are linked to increases in political
  news publication, but even larger increases in political news sharing -- these changes,
  however, vary significantly by country. We also show that, overall, political news
  is shared more often than news publication patterns would suggest, proposing higher
  political interest by Facebook users than previously thought.
